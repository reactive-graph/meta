### [Design System](https://github.com/reactive-graph/design)

<div style="background-color: #333333; padding: 10px 50px; font-size: 12pt;">

Create a design system for Reactive Graph websites and applications. It establishes a common design language, provides reusable coded components, and outlines high level guidelines for content and accessibility. Using the Atomic design methodology the design system is composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner. Also, Web Components are used to create reusable custom elements.

### [OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Program](https://github.com/reactive-graph/meta/issues/1)

<div style="background-color: #333333; padding: 10px 50px; font-size: 12pt;">

The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices badge is a way for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects to show that they follow best practices. Projects can voluntarily self-certify, at no cost, by using this web application to explain how they follow each best practice. The OpenSSF Best Practices Badge is inspired by the many badges available to projects on GitHub. Consumers of the badge can quickly assess which FLOSS projects are following best practices and as a result are more likely to produce higher-quality secure software.
